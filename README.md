# Delta
This is a repository for my programming language Delta, it is still WIP.

## Installation
Use the [Delta Installer](http://about:blank) to download the installer. Then go to your command prompt and enter in:
````bash
deli install lang
````
## Modules (Imports)
Downloading modules for your projects are simple. Type this in your command prompt:

````bash
deli install [SPECIFIC MODULE GOES HERE]
````
Or if you just want to download everything on the spot:
````bash
deli install allmod
````
## Important Things
Delta is based around similar syntax to other programming languages, such as C and all the other ones. This language is statically typed and doesn't care about whitespaces when indenting, anything that goes inside of the curly braces, is now inside of the block. This language also uses semi colons to mark the end of the code. The semi colons have actual use because they are useful when you write a long piece of code.
````
let x: str = "This piece of text is so long that the line can't fit it and the semi colons are actually useful to mark the end
of this line.";
````

### Variable Declaration
This language uses the typescript format for the declaration.
