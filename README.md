# Delta
This is a repository for my programming language Delta, it is still WIP.

## Installation
Use the [Delta Installer](http://about:blank) to download the installer. Then go to your command prompt and enter in:

````bash
deli install lang
````
## Modules (Imports)
It is simple to download modules for your project. Type this in your command prompt:

````bash
deli install [SPECIFIC MODULE GOES HERE]
````
Or if you just want to download everything on the spot:

````bash
deli install allmod
````
