# Delta
This is a repository for my programming language Delta, it is still WIP.

## Installation
Use the [Delta Installer](http://about:blank) to download the installer. Then go to your command prompt and enter in:
````bash
deli install lang
````
## Modules (Imports)
Downloading modules for your projects are simple. Type this in your command prompt:

````bash
deli install [SPECIFIC MODULE GOES HERE]
````
Or if you just want to download everything on the spot:
````bash
deli install allmod
````
## Important Things
Delta is based around similar syntax to other programming languages, such as C and all the other ones.
This language is statically typed and doesn't care about whitespaces when indenting.
